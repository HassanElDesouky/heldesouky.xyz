### 👏 Year review 👏 and new year’s resolutions.

2018 was a good year for me, on many levels. I learned more Swift, made several side projects, made a good résumé, got an iOS engineering internship offer, started taking care of my body and started going to the gym, took more care of my LinkedIn profile and made some valuable connections there, started diving more into problem solving, algorithms and data structures, but the most important thing that I did this year was me going out more and engaging more in the community, like going to some local meetups. I really learned a ton and made good connections there. Finally, I finished this wonderful year by putting myself into a new challenge and it’s blogging at least two times a month.

In 2019 however, I planned to make some new resolution. Some of them are technical and some of them are more on the personal side. let us go over them now one by one.

### New year’s technical-resolutions:

#### 1- Learn new programming languages.

I plan on learning several programming languages this year and do at least one side project in each one of them. The programming languages that I’m planning on learning are:
**JavaScript**: JavaScript is really important now and it’s getting more and more popularity and you basically can do everything with it! You can search more on why you should learn JavaScript, but I’d say it’s really important that you have such a powerful language under your belt.
**Python**: I’ve always wanted to learn python and make some ‘cool’ scripts with it. Another thing that encouraged me to learn Python is its simplicity and how fast you can solve a problem with it, especially when you are in a programming contest or an interview… how fast you can write what is in your mind matters.
**Objective-C**: Maybe you are thinking that, why do I need to learn Obj-C? Especially Swift is gaining more and more popularity and already almost every new app on the store is in Swift, but I’d have to disagree with you especially if you wanted to work in a big company they sure have their app written in Obj-C and working with legacy code and understanding it is important.

#### 2- Lean new technologies.

I’ve always wanted to learn some backend technologies and learn how to build my own API. Therefore I plan to learn **NodeJS**and how to make a **RESTful** API with it. And since I’ll be learning JavaScript already, I think it’s going to be a good practice.

#### 3- Improve my Swift and iOS development skills.

I plan on reading more books about Swift and making more applications and as ‘they say’…

> “Practice makes perfect!”

> — They say

#### 4- Publish at least two applications on the App Store.

This is really one of the most important things that I want to do this year and hopefully, I will. I already have several ideas so stay tuned!

#### **5- Get a summer internship.**

I’m still in my second year at college but I really want to get a summer iOS engineering internship this summer. It will be a challenge since almost all of the applicants are a year older and I have more knowledge than me, but I’m hoping that I’ll get the internship.

#### 6- Found an iOS development club in Kafrelshiekh.

I’m currently founding an iOS development club in my hometown of Kafrelshiekh. I’m still learning and of course, I still have a long path to go, but I really love sharing my knowledge with people, and I really believe learning together with my colleagues is really beneficial and much better than learning alone at home.

#### 7- Have a personal website.

I think, having a personal website with a good domain name, a portfolio with your work on it, and your blog, is really professional and important.

### New year’s personal-resolutions:

#### 1- 2019 Reading Challenge.

I really want to improve my reading skills in English so I plan on reading 50 books in 2019, some of them are in English some in Arabic, some of them are technical, some are fiction. But the most important thing is I’ll read.

#### 2- Learn German.

German is really important language and learning it really opens so many doors for you, like working in Germany or studying there.

#### 3- Get six packs.

I started going to the gym last year in late June. My shape is getting better but I really want to push it to the limits and get that beach body look with six packs and be ‘ripped’ and all, by the summer of 2019.

#### 4- Publish two articles a month on my blog.

I started doing this one in December and I’m planning on continue doing it, hopefully.

#### 5- Start an Arabic podcast.

I will try to start a podcast in Arabic and make one every month or so. It’ll be great to host a podcast.

### Finally,

I really hope that I’ll do all of these resolutions and plans by the end of the year. But most importantly happy new year guys, and don’t forget to enjoy your time!
