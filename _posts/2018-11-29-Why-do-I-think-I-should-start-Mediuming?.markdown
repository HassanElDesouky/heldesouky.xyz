# Why do I think I should start Medium-ing?

### Why do I think I should start Medium-ing?

In the last couple of weeks and all I see on the internet is that‚Ä¶ I
should start a blog! Even the last month I was on a local meetup in
Cairo, Egypt called [Swift Cairo](https://www.meetup.com/SwiftCairo/)
and they recommended us to start our own blog or start writing on
Medium. So‚Ä¶ Here I am!

But I‚Äôm still a just a computer science sophomore student who is an
enthusiast and passionate about iOS development, Apple technologies and
love üçé Apple in general. So‚Ä¶ **Why should I start writing a blog?** And,
to be honest, I‚Äôm still kinda a noob.

Honestly, I found out that writing a blog will help me so much in my
career and my life in general. Here are a few examples:\
**1- Improve my English.**\
**2- Write down my Journey and share my Learning Path.**\
**3- Share my Knowledge.**\
**4- Great exposure and having a Personal Brand.**

#### 1- Improve my¬†English
I‚Äôm from Egypt so of course, my main language is Arabic, and Arabic is
great and all but there is no way that you can do software development
without learning English, all most every resource either if it‚Äôs a book
or video course for learning programming is in English and if there‚Äôs a
course in Arabic there‚Äôs no way it can compete with the variety and
quality of the courses that they are in English. So, I definitely think
that in order to become a good software engineer -or any other
profession to be honest- you have to be good in English or at least
understand it well.\
So, I think writing a blog will definitely help me improve my writing
skills and my English in general.¬†\
As a beginner in writing, of course, I make a lot of grammar and
spelling mistakes so I use a couple of great tools that they help me a
lot in my writing to avoid some of those mistakes, they are:¬†\

-*[*Google Translate
Extension*](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-translate/aapbdbdomjkkjkaonfhkkikfgjllcleb?hl=en)*.*

#### 2- Write down my Journey and share my Learning¬†Path
I have never had a journal before and a lot of times I really wanted to
get one to write down every important thing and every difficult moment
that I have, so when the time passes I remember that I was able to move
past those times and everything eventually will be fine, another thing
is that‚Ä¶ I KNOW that I will work in a major company, so writing down my
journey; like what I‚Äôm currently learning, or what technology that I‚Äôm
working on would be such an inspiring thing to the people starting out
and wanna become like me. LOL!

#### 3- Share my Knowledge
Of course, I‚Äôm still learning and I‚Äôm nowhere near all of the great
developer who posts here. But a lot of time while making my own projects
I would solve a problem that I have through a kinda interesting
approach, and I think it‚Äôll be awesome to share those problems and how I
solved them. So, stay tuned!

#### 4- Great exposure and having a Personal Brand

I think writing a blog gives you a great exposure to almost all of the
community around the globe, so it will definitely open a ton of doors
for other opportunities, businesses, and projects. And you will be well
known on an international scale in the community that you are in.¬†\
I also think when you are a well-known developer and have contributed so
much to the community, wrote so many articles, helped a lot of people.
That will definitely help you when applying to a position in a company‚Ä¶
Just the idea of being able to *google* your name and find yourself in
one of the first search results because you are yourself a brand is a
great thing.

#### Finally

I really hope you enjoyed my first story. Do you agree with what I
think? Or maybe if you have another opinion, I would be glad if you
write it down in the comments. I would love to hear out from you any
advice on starting writing on Medium to make my next story better and if
you liked this one please don‚Äôt forget to follow.
