## 14 Resources to help you get your iOS engineering job

How to pass iOS dev interview? I collected all useful resources to help
you to prepare for the next interview and to get your first dream job…


### How to get the first job as an iOS developer

Thanks to [unDraw](https://undraw.co/) for great illustrations!

If you already read [my last article on interviewing](https://heldesouky.xyz/blog/How-I-failed-39-interviews-and-what-I-ve-learned),
you know that I failed dozens of my previous interviews. In that
article, I mentioned how to improve developers’ hard & soft skills in
order to impress a potential employer.

> Please notice, some of them may seem overkill for you, but I think
> the complexity of the interviews may vary depending on your skills and
> what company you are applying for.

As far as I know, there are two categories of questions companies ask in
the interview:
1. Problem-solving questions
2. iOS related question

I will be going through each of those and providing you with the
resources that I find helpful.

### **Problem-solving questions**

#### Books

The idea here is to solve as many problems as you can. I recommend two
great books:

1.  [**Cracking the Coding Interview**](https://amzn.to/2ta6IbM)
    When you are preparing for interviews you should have a solid
    understanding of algorithms and data structures. After that, you
    should start with reading and doing the problems in Cracking the
    Coding Interview book.
2.  [**Elements of Programming Interviews**](https://amzn.to/2WMDxJf)
    You should start in Elements of Programming Interviews book after
    you have solved multiple questions from CtCI as the problems in this
    book are harder than those in the CtCI book.

#### Websites 

You can also solve problems from websites like:

1.  [**LeetCode**](https://leetcode.com/)
    It’s a great website for solving whiteboard like questions.
2.  [**GeeksforGeeks**](http://GeeksforGeeks.org)
    I had an interview with Google once, and I found out similar
    questions to those that I interviewed in on websites like
    [LeetCode](http://leetcode.com) and
    [GeeksforGeeks](http://GeeksforGeeks.org). So, I really recommend
    checking those websites if you have a technical interview.
3.  [HackerRank Interview Preparation Kit](https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/interview-preparation-kit)
    After I study a specific data structure. I solve problems from
    Cracking the Coding Interview book*.*Then, I solve easy to medium
    problems about the topic in which I’m studying from LeetCode.
    Finally, I might solve a problem or tow about the same topic from
    HackerRank’s Interview Preparation Kit.\
    I do my best to try to solve from multiple sites as it opens my mind
    to different problems and strengthens my coding skills.

#### Mock interviews

I’ve used this website multiple times and I highly recommend this
website for practicing mock interviews with a real person.

-   [**Pramp.com**](https://www.pramp.com/invt/M6Vb0Gpz3gsGoJJ7Mo3P)
    It’s really recommended to practice the interview style with
    someone of your friends. You can practice mock interviews on this
    website. I really recommend this website, for practicing an
    interview-like setting.

### **iOS related question**

#### Books

I personally haven’t used these books but I heard some very good
feedback about them.

1.  [Swift Coding Challenges](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/store/swift-coding-challenges)
    Swift Coding Challenges book is one of [Paul
    Hudson](https://twitter.com/twostraws) great books. It sets you the
    task of solving the most common questions you’ll get asked at coding
    interviews. You get hints in case you get stuck, then complete
    solutions so you can compare your results.
2.  [**The iOS Interview Guide**](https://iosinterviewguide.com/)
    This guide will help you prepare for your next interview by
    systematizing the learning, helping you refresh what you already
    know, and giving you answers to common iOS interview questions.
3.  **Read** [Advanced Swift](https://www.objc.io/books/advanced-swift/)
    It’s a great book to learn more beyond the basics of Swift.

#### Videos

[Sean Allen](https://twitter.com/seanallen_dev) playlist helped me a lot
in my interview, and honestly, I owe him a lot for that.

You can watch a video then try to also search online more about the
topic he was talking about to help you get a deeper understanding of the
topic.

-   [Swift Interview Tips](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8seg1JPkqgF5wazzCKSq3EEfqt3t8mvA)

#### Apps

An open source application for viewing Swift Algorithm Club markdown
resources.

-   [**Algorithms & Data Structures**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/algorithms-data-structures/id1431032601?mt=8)(App Store)
-   [**Algorithms & Data Structures**](https://github.com/thexande/SwiftAlgorithms) (Github repo)

#### Websites

Using “be the compiler” tests. This will present you with 20 questions
graded at three difficulty levels, and ask you to choose a correct
answer. This is a highly technical test designed to hone your Swift
knowledge. Also created by [Paul Hudson](https://twitter.com/twostraws).

-   [**Test your Swift skills**](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/test)

If you are struggling to create iOS applications and can’t have a good
resume because you are not a designer you can also buy some great [iOS App Templates](https://www.iosapptemplates.com/) and if you are more
interested in [React Native App Templates](https://www.instamobile.io/)
you can buy them from here they have a really great collection.

#### Articles and Github repos

1.  [**RW Swift Interview Questions and Answers**](https://www.raywenderlich.com/762435-swift-interview-questions-and-answers)
    In this article, you’ll work through a series of Swift-specific
    interview questions and answers.
2.  [**How to get a job as an iOS developer**](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/10/how-to-get-a-job-as-an-ios-developer)  A great article by [Paul Hudson](https://twitter.com/twostraws)
    that really discuss deeply how you can get a job as an iOS
    developer.
3.  [**Awesome Interview Questions**](https://github.com/MaximAbramchuck/awesome-interview-questions#ios)

### Conclusion

Anyways, I wish you luck passing your next interview and getting your
iOS engineering job.

Don’t forget to share with me any other resources that you found helpful
in passing your interviews.
