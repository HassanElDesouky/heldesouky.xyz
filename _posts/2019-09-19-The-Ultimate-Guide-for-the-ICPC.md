### What is the ICPC?

> “The ICPC, the ‘International Collegiate Programming Contest,’ is an
> extra-curricular, competitive programming sport for students at
> universities around the world. ICPC competitions provide gifted
> students opportunities to interact, demonstrate, and improve their
> teamwork, programming, and problem-solving process. The ICPC is a
> global platform for academia, industry, and community to shine the
> spotlight on and raise the aspirations of the next generation of
> computing professionals as they pursue
> excellence.” — [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest)

#### Disclaimer

I’m by no mean a top coder or a world finalist. I just wanted to share
the resources I found helpful, and if you follow them, hopefully, you
will be an ICPC world finalist.

### Introduction

I really like competitive programming, and I really want to be someone
like [Gennady
Korotkevich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gennady_Korotkevich). He is
truly a living legend in the field of competitive programming.

Anyways, let’s get into the details …

* * * * *

### The Steps to be a Good Competitive Programmer

It’s really simple: There are no tricks and there’s no short way … all
you need is dedication and a goal, and you are all set.

First, you will need to be familiar with at least one of the following
programming languages: Python, Java, C, or C++.

Secondly, you will need to study all of the different topics about data
structures and algorithms.

Finally, do a lot of problems … *a lot!*

### Resources

[“Competitive Programming 3”](http://www.lulu.com/shop/http://www.lulu.com/shop/steven-halim/competitive-programming-3paperback/product-21059906.html) This book is beyond great. I’m currently in the middle of it and I’m enjoying
the problems and the book structure. I highly recommended it.

[“The ‘Science’ of Training in Competitive Programming”](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/17842) In this
blog,the author explains how to train for CP and what he did in order to
be a good problem solver.

[How to be a red coder](https://www.quora.com/TopCoder/By-practicing-can-one-become-a-red-yellow-coder-at-Topcoder-despite-not-being-that-intelligent-I%E2%80%99m-a-gray-coder-and-really-want-to-excel-in-algorithmic-programming-Is-practice-the-only-factor-that-can-make-one-red-or-yellow)
This Quora answer really goes deep into how to be a red coder and train
efficiently.
