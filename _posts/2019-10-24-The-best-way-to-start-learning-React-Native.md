### The best way to start learning React Native

I’ll be doing a project using React Native this semester for college.
So, I gathered every resource that I thought it might be helpful for
someone starting to learn React Native.

> But firstly… What’s React Native?

#### What’s React Native

React Native is an exciting framework that enables web developers to
create robust mobile applications using their existing JavaScript
knowledge. It offers faster mobile development, and more efficient code
sharing across iOS, Android, and the Web, without sacrificing the end
user’s experience or application quality. The tradeoff is that it’s new,
and still a work in progress. If your team can handle the uncertainty
that comes with working with new technology and wants to develop mobile
applications for more than just one platform, you should be looking at
React Native.

#### Why React Native

The first and foremost reason to use React Native is that the developer
has to write one set of code, (JavaScript code) to enjoy the performance
of the REACT Native Mobile Applications.

Pros:
1. **Cross-Platform** The React Native apps can be developed via using a single codebase for
both the platforms simultaneously, which increased its popularity even
more.

2. **Performance** At the initial stages, ‘hybrid’ or ‘mobile web’ apps were popular for
their uncommonness mainly. However, when it comes to performance, the
complicated the apps, the more lags it experienced. The REACT Native
apps are compiled into natively written code, which enables it to not
only work on both the operating systems but also functions the same way
on both the platforms with no lags at all.

Other benefits of using REACT Native Framework include its faster
development, ability to reuse components and ease to be maintained.
Besides, it is a timesaving process and therefore many industries and
even individuals today prefer using React Native along with
[NodeJS](https://www.thinkwik.com/nodejs-development.html) for creating
astonishing mobile applications.

Cons:
1. **It’s Technological Edge** Though the React Native’s pre-packaged elements set you aside from
having much technical advancement, however, you will still need a
professional developer to watch out some technical glitches and bugs.

2. **Might be killed overnight!** Since the social media giant Facebook has developed this framework,
its existence remained uncertain as Facebook has all the rights to kill
off the project anytime. Though with the current popularity of the
technology, it is unlikely to happen.

#### Introduction

First of all, if you know how to code, then you are all set… but if you
don’t know how to code you should check out some introductory courses
first to get you started with programming and after that, come back
again.

The best way to learn React Native is to understand what mobile
development is. I am coming from iOS, so I have an idea of what building
an app looks like. What I mean is that you need to know the basic
concepts like NavigationController and TabBar… etc.

You need to get these things straight because you will be using them in
React Native. A few people would suggest implementing them in Kotlin,
Java or Objective-C/Swift and then see how they work in React Native,
but I don’t think that is strictly necessary.

#### The next steps

-   Start by reading the getting started tutorial and try to run it on
    your machine. It’s the first thing I did. This will give you a sense
    of what we are talking about. [Getting Started — React Native | A framework for building native apps using React](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)
-   Read about the Components specs and lifecycle in React. RN comes
    from ReactJS, they have a lot of things in common and understanding
    things like componentDidMount() or componentWillMount() will help
    you. [Component Specs and Lifecycle | React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/component-specs.html)
-   Then read Pete Hunt’s tutorial about ReactJS. You need to understand
    what components are and how they are implemented. [Thinking in React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html)
-   I would suggest going through the other sample apps, all of them.
    Read code and when you don’t understand something, just Google it.
    If you want to see how an app needs to be structured in the proper
    way, you may want to have a look at the Facebook8 App
    ([fbsamples/f8app](https://github.com/fbsamples/f8app)). This is
    really good, but it’s not for beginners. Come back here when you
    want to see how to use Redux in a React Native app.
-   There are plenty of tutorials that explain how to write a simple app
    in React Native. You can use this one: [Going native with React, an introduction](https://ryanclark.me/going-native-with-react). It’s
    probably outdated by now, but it will give you an idea on what you
    need to complete your project.
-   Yes, I said project. You need something to start with. You learn by
    coding (and reading), not just reading or (even worse) watching. Why
    don’t you try to implement Instagram? Tinder could be another idea.
-   Don’t read the Docs. It’s not a book, but just a reference to the
    things you will need to use along your journey, so while developing
    keep a tab open, if you are not familiar with it. Keep in mind that
    React Native is moving fast, so you may want to check them from time
    to time.
-   Have a look at [Share and test your React Native code in the browser](https://rnplay.org/). This is a really interesting resource
    with a lot of examples. You will find it integrated in the docs as
    well.
-   Download the Facebook 8 app, Facebook Groups (this is not 100% React
    Native), Facebook Ads’ Manager and open the events view on your
    Facebook app. Welcome to React Native.
